1. On terminal/command prompt, run the following command

python trip_match.py <input_file1> <input_file2> <window_size> <interpolation_size> <slicing_factor> <match_threshold>

2. To reproduce the results that I obtained experimenting on the provided data sets (recommended), please run the following command:

python trip_match.py mobile_trips.json obd2_trips.json 10 50 0.5 0.3


2. All figures for matching trip pairs will be generated in the "plots" folder which is located in the same directory as trip_match.py.
